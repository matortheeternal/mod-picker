## PyNexusCrawler
PyNexusCrawler is a rudimentry python implementation of a crawler for Nexus Mods mod pages.

### Usage
Use `python PyNexusCrawler.py` to run it from a command line.  Enter a valid Skyrim Nexus Mods file id (e.g. 3863 for SkyUI) and the script will parse and print out data it finds on that mod.  The script will also download the first image in the mod's image gallery to a file named after the mod's id in the working directory.
