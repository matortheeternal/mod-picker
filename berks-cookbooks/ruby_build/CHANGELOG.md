# 1.0.0 / 2016-07-18

## BREAKING CHANGES:

- This cookbook has been moved under the chef-rbenv Github organization to allow for additional committers and further maintenance
- The cookbook now requires Chef 12 due to the use of multi-package installations
- Existing lists of package dependencies have been updated to match those on the ruby-build wiki. This removes several runtime dependencies such as readline, zlib, and subversion

## Additional Changes

- Added support for installing Rubinius dependencies when installing Rubinius
- Added dependency installation on OS X machines
- Added support for FreeBSD
- Added a dependency on yum-epel when on RHEL
- Added Travis CI integration testing using kitchen-dokken and inspec
- Added cookstyle for Ruby linting and resolved all warnings
- Updated the ruby-build Github URL to the new location
- Switched package dependency logic to use platform_family which supports additional derivative distros
- Add source_url, issues_url, and chef_version metadata to metadata.rb
- Updated the LWRP to use use_inline_resources for proper update notifications
- Added a Chef 11+ style default_action to the LWRP
- Updated attribute file to use default instead of node.set which avoids deprecation warnings
- Updated the Berksfile to use Supermarket
- Updated the Gemfile with the latest testing dependencies
- Added the Apache 2.0 license file
- Updated readme to remove HTML tables that don't render in Supermarket
- Swapped the Rakefile for the standard Chef Rakefile
