A LWRP is also defined.","long_description":"# ruby-build Chef Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-rbenv/ruby_build.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-rbenv/ruby_build)\n\n## Description\n\nManages the [ruby-build][rb_site] framework and its installed Rubies. A lightweight resources and providers (lwrp) is also defined.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply include `recipe[ruby_build]` in your run_list to have ruby-build installed. You will also have access to the `ruby_build_ruby` resource. See the See Resources and Providers section for more details.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12+\n\n### Platforms\n\nThe following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the recipes and LWRPs run on these platforms without error:\n\n- ubuntu 12.04+\n- mac_os_x\n- debian 7+\n- freebsd 9+\n- rhel 6+\n- fedora\n- suse 13+\n\nThere might be more that work successfully as well, but those are not tested in test kitchen.\n\nPlease [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.\n\n### Cookbooks\n\nThere are **no** external cookbook dependencies. However, if you are installing [JRuby] then a Java runtime will need to be installed. The Opscode [java cookbook][java_cb] can be used on supported platforms.\n\n## Installation\n\nDepending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development.\n\n### From Supermarket\n\nTo install this cookbook from the Chef Supermarket, use the _knife_ command:\n\n```\nknife cookbook site install ruby_build\n```\n\n### Using Berkshelf\n\n[Berkshelf] is a cookbook dependency manager and development workflow assistant. To install Berkshelf:\n\n```\ncd chef-repo\ngem install berkshelf\nberks init\n```\n\nTo use the Supermarket version:\n\n```\necho \"cookbook 'ruby_build'\" >> Berksfile\nberks install\n```\n\nOr to reference the Git version:\n\n```\nrepo=\"chef_rbenv/ruby_build\"\nlatest_release=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$repo/git/refs/tags \\\n| ruby -rjson -e '\n  j = JSON.parse(STDIN.read);\n  puts j.map { |t| t[\"ref\"].split(\"/\").last }.sort.last\n')\ncat >> Berksfile <<END_OF_BERKSFILE\ncookbook 'ruby_build',\n  :git => 'git://github.com/$repo.git', :branch => '$latest_release'\nEND_OF_BERKSFILE\n```\n\n## Recipes\n\n### default\n\nInstalls the ruby-build codebase and initializes Chef to use the Lightweight Resources and Providers ([LWRPs][lwrp]).\n\n## Attributes\n\n### git_url\n\nThe Git URL which is used to install ruby-build.\n\nThe default is `\"git://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git\"`.\n\n### git_ref\n\nA specific Git branch/tag/reference to use when installing ruby-build. For example, to pin ruby-build to a specific release:\n\n```ruby\nnode['ruby_build']['git_ref'] = \"v20111030\"\n```\n\nThe default is `\"master\"`.\n\n### default_ruby_base_path\n\nThe default base path for a system-wide installed Ruby. For example, the following resource:\n\n```ruby\nruby_build_ruby \"1.9.3-p0\"\n```\n\nwill be installed into `\"#{node['ruby_build']['default_ruby_base_path']}/1.9.3-p0\"` unless a `prefix_path` attribute is explicitly set.\n\nThe default is `\"/usr/local/ruby\"`.\n\n### upgrade\n\nDetermines how to handle installing updates to the ruby-build framework. There are currently 2 valid values:\n\n- `\"none\"`, `false`, or `nil`: will not update ruby-build and leave it in its current state.\n- `\"sync\"` or `true`: updates ruby-build to the version specified by the `git_ref` attribute or the head of the master branch by default.\n\nThe default is `\"none\"`.\n\n## Resources and Providers\n\n### ruby_build_ruby\n\n#### Actions\n\nAction    | Description                                                                                                                           | Default\n--------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------\ninstall   | Build and install a Ruby from a definition file. See the [ruby-build readme][rb_readme] for more details.                             | Yes\nreinstall | Force a recompiliation of the Ruby from source. The :install action will skip a build if the target install directory already exists. |\n\n#### Attributes\n\nAttribute   | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | Default Value\n----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------\ndefinition  | **Name attribute:** the name of a [built-in definition][rb_definitions] or the path to a ruby-build definition file.                                                                   | `nil`\nprefix_path | The path to which the Ruby will be installed.                                                                                                                                          | `nil`\nuser        | A user which will own the installed Ruby. The default value of `nil` denotes a system-wide Ruby (root-owned) is being targeted. **Note:** if specified, the user must already exist.   | `nil`\ngroup       | A group which will own the installed Ruby. The default value of `nil` denotes a system-wide Ruby (root-owned) is being targeted. **Note:** if specified, the group must already exist. | `nil`\nenvironment | A Hash of [additional environment variables][rb_environment] such as `CONFIGURE_OPTS` or `RUBY_BUILD_MIRROR_URL`.                                                                      | `nil`\n\n#### Examples\n\n##### Install Ruby\n\n```ruby\n# See: https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/issues/186\nruby_build_ruby \"ree-1.8.7-2012.02\" do\n  environment({ 'CONFIGURE_OPTS' => '--no-tcmalloc' })\nend\n\nruby_build_ruby \"1.9.3-p0\" do\n  prefix_path \"/usr/local/ruby/ruby-1.9.3-p0\"\n  environment({\n    'RUBY_BUILD_MIRROR_URL' => 'http://local.example.com'\n  })\n\n  action      :install\nend\n\nruby_build_ruby \"jruby-1.6.5\"\n```\n\n**Note:** the install action is default, so the second example is more common.\n\n##### Install A Ruby For A User\n\n```ruby\nruby_build_ruby \"maglev-1.0.0\" do\n  prefix_path \"/home/deploy/.rubies/maglev-1.0.0\"\n  user        \"deploy\"\n  group       \"deploy\"\nend\n```\n\n##### Reinstall Ruby\n\n```ruby\nruby_build_ruby \"rbx-1.2.4\" do\n  prefix_path \"/opt/rbx-1.2.4\"\n\n  action      :reinstall\nend\n```\n\n**Note:** the Ruby will be built whether or not the Ruby exists in the `prefix_path` directory.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nPublic work on this cookbook has resumed after a hiatus. Accordingly, some combinations of versions have issues that you have to work around.\n\n1. Ubuntu 12.04 and rubinius needs an apt repo for LLVM as the build tools rely on LLVM version between 3.0 and 3.5:\n\n  ```ruby\n  apt_repository 'llvm' do\n  uri 'http://llvm.org/apt/precise'\n  distribution 'llvm-toolchain-precise-3.5'\n  components ['main']\n  end\n  ```\n\n2. Ubuntu 14.04 and ruby 2.0.0 patch versions <457\n\n  - The readline and openssl extensions have an [issue](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741825) patched in 457\n\n## Development\n\n- Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n- Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested. Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.\n\n## License and Author\n\nAuthor:: [Fletcher Nichol][fnichol] ([fnichol@nichol.ca](mailto:fnichol@nichol.ca))\n\nCopyright 2011-2016, Fletcher Nichol\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
