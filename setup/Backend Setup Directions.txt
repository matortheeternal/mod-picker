Step 1:
Download MySQL 5.6
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.6.html
(do the zip installer)

Step 2:
Extract the folder from the archive wherever you want.  I'd recommend using folder like C:\dev\db\

Step 3:
Download Ruby 2.0.0-p647 (x64)
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

Step 4:
Run the ruby installer and make sure to check the box to add ruby executables to your path.
I recommend using a folder like C:\dev\lang\

Step 5:
Add the mysql bin folder to your system's %path% environment variable.
Run the mysqld service using Win+R.

Step 6:
Run a new cmd window (fast way is Winr+R, type cmd, and press enter) and type mysql -u root -p, and then leave the password blank.

Step 7:
Enter show databases; and press enter.  This should show you all active mysql databases.
Enter create database mod_picker; to create a new database for our site.

Step 8:
Make a new cmd window in the directory where setup.sql is (hold shift, right click in the directory, and choose open command window here).  Then run the command:  mysql -u root -p mod_picker < setup.sql.  Leave the password blank, then close the command window.

Step 9:
In the command window still open type "use mod_picker;", press enter, and then type "show tables;".  You should see all tables in our schema there.  There should be 35 of them.  Screenshot: http://puu.sh/lJmz1.png
